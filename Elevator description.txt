Project Overview:

The project involves designing an elevator control system in Verilog.
The elevator can move between four floors labeled A, B, C, and D.
The elevator is controlled by inputs (ra, rb, rc, rd) representing requests from each floor.
The output floor indicates the current floor of the elevator.
Module Structure:

The main module is named elevator.
It takes inputs clk, rst, ra, rb, rc, rd, and outputs [1:0] floor.
States and Direction:

The elevator system has states A, B, C, and D, corresponding to the different floors.
The elevator can move in two directions: UP and DOWN.
The direction is controlled by the dir signal.
The elevator moves based on inputs and direction:
When in state A, moves to B, C, or D depending on the input and direction.
When in state B, moves to A, C, or D based on input and direction.
Similar movement patterns for states C and D.
State Transition Logic:

State transitions occur on the rising edge of the clock (clk).
Transitions are also influenced by the reset signal (rst).
Nested case statements are used to handle different conditions for transitions.
Direction Logic:

The elevator direction is determined by the dir signal.
Direction changes occur on the rising edge of the clock.
Similar to state transitions, nested case statements control the direction based on the current state and inputs.
Input Handling:

Inputs ra, rb, rc, rd represent floor requests.
Input values are updated sequentially in the testbench to simulate requests.
The elevator responds to the requests by transitioning states and changing direction.
Testbench:

A SystemVerilog testbench is provided for verification.
Clock (clk), reset (rst), and input requests are simulated.
Assertions are used to verify the correctness of the elevator's behavior.
Coverage points help track the scenarios exercised during simulation.
Verification and Adjustments:

Assertions and coverage points need to be customized based on expected behavior.
Simulation results and waveform output (elevator_tb.vcd) can be analyzed to verify the module's correctness.
